You can save this code in a .php file (e.g., hello_github.php) and then upload it to your GitHub repository. This script will display the "Hello, GitHub!" message when it's executed.

To create a GitHub repository and upload your PHP script, follow these steps:

Sign in to your GitHub account or create one if you don't have one already.

Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the GitHub website and select "New repository."

Fill in the repository name, description, and choose other settings as needed.

Click the "Create repository" button.

On the repository page, you'll find instructions on how to push your existing code or create a new repository from the command line. You can follow these instructions to upload your PHP script to the repository.

After uploading, your PHP script will be available in your GitHub repository, and others can view and access it.
